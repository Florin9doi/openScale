        This path allows sharing files from the "logs" subdirectory
        within your app's specific directory on external storage.
        This corresponds to what context.getExternalFilesDir("logs") would point to.

    <!--
        Consider if LogManager might also use internal storage in some cases or for old logs.
        If your LogManager.getOldLogFile() could potentially point to
        context.getFilesDir() + "/logs/", you might need this too.
        If you are *only* using getExternalFilesDir("logs"), then the entry above is sufficient.
